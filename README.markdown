# MspGang Tool for Python

Elprotronics, working with Texas Instruments, has developed a great tool for
flashing many MSP products at once.  However their API is very window centric.

To speed development, we have created a python interface to their product, for
use in our internal pogramming and testing rigs.

We are releasing this software as GNU Affero GPL, for general use. 

If you need an different license to make this codebase useful to you, please contact 
us at BuLogics and we can discuss a licensing system that will work for you needs. 

Thanks to the worldwide Open Source community,
