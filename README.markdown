# MspGang Tool for Python

Elprotronics, working with Texas Instruments, has developed a great tool for
flashing many MSP products at once.  However their API is very window centric. To 
speed development, we have created a python interface to their product, for use 
in our internal pogramming and testing rigs.

We are releasing this software as GNU Affero GPL, for general use. 

If you are a commercial company and need a different license to make this 
codebase useful to you, please contact us at info@BuLogics.com with the subject 
line 'libMspGang License Request' and we can discuss a licensing system that will 
work for you needs. 

Thanks to the worldwide Open Source community for cool tools, this is our
contribution back.
